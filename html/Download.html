        <h2> DOWNLOAD NO HOMEWORK! FOR WINDOWS </h2> <br>
        Step 1: You'll need to own NO HOMEWORK! for PC/Mac to play the full version. If you havenâ€™t bought it already go here and buy it quick! <br> <br>
        Step 2: INSTALL AND RUN THE GAME <br> <br>
        Step 3: Download and open NoHomework.exe to run the game installer. Then just follow the instructions in the installer. <br><br>
        
        You'll need an internet connection the first time you launch the game, but after that you can play offline without any issues. <br><br> 
        
        <h3> PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS </h3> <br><br>
        If you're planning on playing with friends, the easiest option is to start a subscription to Homework Realms. You can also set up your own NoHomework server from home, though that's a bit trickier to do. There are also a bunch of online servers elsewhere on the internet. <br> <br>
